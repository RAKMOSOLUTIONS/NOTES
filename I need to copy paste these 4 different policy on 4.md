## **Instructions for WordPress Elementor:**

1. **Open your WordPress admin dashboard**
2. **Navigate to the page where you want to add the policy**
3. **Click "Edit with Elementor"**
4. **Drag and drop the "Text Editor" widget** onto your page
5. **Switch to the "Text" tab** (not Visual) in the Text Editor widget
6. **Copy and paste the HTML code** from any of the four policies above
7. **Click "Update"** to save your changes

## **Alternative Method (HTML Widget):**

If you prefer to use the HTML widget instead:

1. **Drag and drop the "HTML" widget** onto your page
2. **Paste the HTML code directly** into the HTML widget
3. **Click "Update"** to save

## **Important Notes:**

- **Use HTML Widget for Best Results**: The HTML widget in Elementor preserves formatting better than the Text Editor widget[^1][^2][^3]
- **Copy from Text Tab**: When using Text Editor widget, always paste in the "Text" tab, not the "Visual" tab[^4][^5]
- **Formatting Preservation**: The HTML formatting will ensure your policies maintain proper structure, headings, lists, and tables[^6][^7]
- **Mobile Responsive**: The HTML formatting is mobile-responsive and will display correctly on all devices

These policies are now formatted specifically for WordPress Elementor with proper HTML tags that will preserve the professional formatting, headings, bullet points, and table structures when pasted into your website.
